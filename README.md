My submissions for the Advent of Code 2023.
This was my first time taking on Advent of Code set by Eric Wastl [(web link)](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about)

+  Some of the tasks were very tricky, with ways to trip up unsuspecting coders. I managed to evade all the difficulties and emerge successful - with a tip here and there from the web. 🎅🤶
